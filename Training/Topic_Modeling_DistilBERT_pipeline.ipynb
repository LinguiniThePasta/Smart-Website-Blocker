    "The nullification crisis was a sectional political crisis in the United States in 1832 and 1833, during the presidency of Andrew Jackson, which involved a confrontation between the state of South Carolina and the federal government. It ensued after South Carolina declared the federal Tariffs of 1828 and 1832 unconstitutional and therefore null and void within the sovereign boundaries of the state. However, courts at the state and federal level, including the U.S. Supreme Court, repeatedly have rejected the theory of nullification by states.[1][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "The controversial and highly protective Tariff of 1828 was enacted into law during the presidency of John Quincy Adams. The tariff was strongly opposed in the South, since it was perceived to put an unfair tax burden on the Southern agrarian states that imported most manufactured goods. The tariff's opponents expected that Jackson's election as president would result in its significant reduction.[3] When the Jackson administration failed to take any action to address their concerns, South Carolina's most radical faction began to advocate that the state nullify the tariff. They subscribed to the legal theory that if a state believed a federal law unconstitutional, it could declare the law null and void in the state. In Washington, an open split on the issue occurred between Jackson and Vice President John C. Calhoun, a native South Carolinian and the most effective proponent of the constitutional theory of state nullification.[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "On July 1, 1832, before Calhoun resigned the vice presidency to run for the Senate, where he could more effectively defend nullification,[5] Jackson signed into law the Tariff of 1832. This compromise tariff received the support of most Northerners and half the Southerners in Congress.[6] South Carolina remained unsatisfied, and on November 24, 1832, a state convention adopted the Ordinance of Nullification, which declared that the Tariffs of 1828 and 1832 were unconstitutional and unenforceable in South Carolina after February 1, 1833.[7] South Carolina initiated military preparations to resist anticipated federal enforcement,[8] but on March 1, 1833, Congress passed both the Force Bill—authorizing the president to use military forces against South Carolina—and a new negotiated tariff, the Compromise Tariff of 1833, which was satisfactory to South Carolina. The South Carolina convention reconvened and repealed its Nullification Ordinance on March 15, 1833, but three days later, nullified the Force Bill as a symbolic gesture of principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crisis was over, and both sides found reasons to claim victory. The tariff rates were reduced and stayed low to the satisfaction of the South, but the states' rights doctrine of nullification remained controversial. By the 1850s, the issues of the expansion of slavery into the western territories and the threat of the Slave Power became the central issues in the nation.[9]\n",
    "Background (1787–1816)\n",
    "\n",
    "The historian Richard E. Ellis wrote:\n",
    "\n",
    "    By creating a national government with the authority to act directly upon individuals, by denying to the state many of the prerogatives that they formerly had, and by leaving open to the central government the possibility of claiming for itself many powers not explicitly assigned to it, the Constitution and Bill of Rights as finally ratified substantially increased the strength of the central government at the expense of the states.[10]\n",
    "\n",
    "The extent of this change and the problem of the actual distribution of powers between state and the federal governments would be a matter of political and ideological discussion through the Civil War as well as afterwards.[11] In the early 1790s the debate centered on Alexander Hamilton's nationalistic financial program versus Jefferson's democratic and agrarian program, a conflict that led to the formation of two opposing national political parties. Later in the decade the Alien and Sedition Acts led to the states' rights position being articulated in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions.[12] The Kentucky Resolutions, written by Thomas Jefferson, contained the following, which has often been cited as a justification for both nullification and secession:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ... that in cases of an abuse of the delegated powers, the members of the general government, being chosen by the people, a change by the people would be the constitutional remedy; but, where powers are assumed which have not been delegated, a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy: that every State has a natural right in cases not within the compact, (casus non fœderis) to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits: that without this right, they would be under the dominion, absolute and unlimited, of whosoever might exercise this right of judgment for them: that nevertheless, this commonwealth, from motives of regard and respect for its co-States, has wished to communicate with them on the subject: that with them alone it is proper to communicate, they alone being parties to the compact, and solely authorized to judge in the last resort of the powers exercised under it ...[13]\n",
    "\n",
    "The Virginia Resolutions, written by James Madison, hold a similar argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The resolutions, having taken this view of the Federal compact, proceed to infer that, in cases of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of other powers, not granted by the said compact, the States, who are parties thereto, have the right, and are in duty bound to interpose to arrest the evil, and for maintaining, within their respective limits, the authorities, rights, and liberties appertaining to them. ... The Constitution of the United States was formed by the sanction of the States, given by each in its sovereign capacity. It adds to the stability and dignity, as well as to the authority of the Constitution, that it rests on this solid foundation. The States, then, being parties to the constitutional compact, and in their sovereign capacity, it follows of necessity that there can be no tribunal above their authority to decide, in the last resort, whether the compact made by them be violated; and, consequently, as parties to it, they must themselves decide, in the last resort, such questions as may be of sufficient magnitude to require their interposition.[14]\n",
    "\n",
    "Historians differ over the extent to which either resolution advocated the doctrine of nullification. Historian Lance Banning wrote, \"The legislators of Kentucky (or more likely, John Breckinridge, the Kentucky legislator who sponsored the resolution) deleted Jefferson's suggestion that the rightful remedy for federal usurpation was a \"nullification\" of such acts by each state acting on its own to prevent their operation within its respective borders. Rather than suggesting individual, although concerted, measures of this sort, Kentucky was content to ask its sisters to unite in declarations that the acts were \"void and of no force\", and in \"requesting their appeal\" at the succeeding session of the Congress.\"[15] The key sentence, and the word \"nullification\" was used in supplementary Resolutions passed by Kentucky in 1799.[16]\n",
    "\n",
    "Madison's judgment is clearer. He was chairman of a committee of the Virginia Legislature, which issued a book-length Report on the Resolutions of 1798, published in 1800 after they had been decried by several states. This asserted that the state did not claim legal force. \"The declarations in such cases are expressions of opinion, unaccompanied by other effect than what they may produce upon opinion, by exciting reflection. The opinions of the judiciary, on the other hand, are carried into immediate effect by force.\" If the states collectively agreed in their declarations, there were several methods by which it might prevail, from persuading Congress to repeal the unconstitutional law, to calling a constitutional convention, as two-thirds of the states may.[17] When, at the time of the nullification crisis, he was presented with the Kentucky resolutions of 1799, he argued that the resolutions themselves were not Jefferson's words, and that Jefferson meant this not as a constitutional, but as a revolutionary right.[18]\n",
    "\n",
    "Madison biographer Ralph Ketcham wrote:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Though Madison agreed entirely with the specific condemnation of the Alien and Sedition Acts, with the concept of the limited delegated power of the general government, and even with the proposition that laws contrary to the Constitution were illegal, he drew back from the declaration that each state legislature had the power to act within its borders against the authority of the general government to oppose laws the legislature deemed unconstitutional.[19]\n",
    "\n",
    "Historian Sean Wilentz explains the widespread opposition to these resolutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Several states followed Maryland's House of Delegates in rejecting the idea that any state could, by legislative action, even claim that a federal law was unconstitutional, and suggested that any effort to do so was treasonous. A few northern states, including Massachusetts, denied the powers claimed by Kentucky and Virginia and insisted that the Sedition law was perfectly constitutional . ... Ten state legislatures with heavy Federalist majorities from around the country censured Kentucky and Virginia for usurping powers that supposedly belonged to the federal judiciary. Northern Republicans supported the resolutions' objections to the alien and sedition acts, but opposed the idea of state review of federal laws. Southern Republicans outside Virginia and Kentucky were eloquently silent about the matter, and no southern legislature heeded the call to battle.[20]\n",
    "\n",
    "Portrait of Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale, 1800\n",
    "\n",
    "The election of 1800 was a turning point in national politics, as the Federalists were replaced by the Democratic-Republican Party led by Jefferson, but the four presidential terms spanning the period from 1800 to 1817 \"did little to advance the cause of states' rights and much to weaken it.\" Over Jefferson's opposition, the power of the federal judiciary, led by Federalist Chief Justice John Marshall, increased. Jefferson expanded federal powers with the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory and his use of a national embargo designed to prevent involvement in a European war. Madison in 1809 used national troops to enforce a Supreme Court decision in Pennsylvania, appointed an \"extreme nationalist\" in Joseph Story to the Supreme Court, signed the bill creating the Second Bank of the United States, and called for a constitutional amendment to promote internal improvements.[21]\n",
    "\n",
    "Opposition to the War of 1812 was centered in New England. Delegates to a convention in Hartford, Connecticut, met in December 1814 to consider a New England response to Madison's war policy. The debate allowed many radicals to argue the cause of states' rights and state sovereignty. In the end, moderate voices dominated and the final product was not secession or nullification, but a series of proposed constitutional amendments.[22] Identifying the South's domination of the government as the cause of much of their problems, the proposed amendments included \"the repeal of the three-fifths clause, a requirement that two-thirds of both houses of Congress agree before any new state could be admitted to the Union, limits on the length of embargoes, and the outlawing of the election of a president from the same state to successive terms, clearly aimed at the Virginians.\"[23] The war was over before the proposals were submitted to President Madison.\n",
    "James Madison\n",
    "\n",
    "After the conclusion of the War of 1812 Sean Wilentz notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Madison's speech [his 1815 annual message to Congress] affirmed that the war had reinforced the evolution of mainstream Republicanism, moving it further away from its original and localist assumptions. The war's immense strain on the treasury led to new calls from nationalist Republicans for a national bank. The difficulties in moving and supplying troops exposed the wretchedness of the country's transportation links, and the need for extensive new roads and canals. A boom in American manufacturing during the prolonged cessation of trade with Britain created an entirely new class of enterprisers, most of them tied politically to the Republicans, who might not survive without tariff protection. More broadly, the war reinforced feelings of national identity and connection.[24]\n",
    "\n",
    "This spirit of nationalism was linked to the tremendous growth and economic prosperity of this postwar era. However in 1819, the nation suffered its first financial panic and the 1820s turned out to be a decade of political turmoil that again led to fierce debates over competing views of the exact nature of American federalism. The \"extreme democratic and agrarian rhetoric\" that had been so effective in 1798 led to renewed attacks on the \"numerous market-oriented enterprises, particularly banks, corporations, creditors, and absentee landholders\".[25]\n",
    "Tariffs (1816–1828)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tariff of 1816 had some protective features, and it received support throughout the nation, including that of John C. Calhoun and fellow South Carolinian William Lowndes.[26] The first explicitly protective tariff linked to a specific program of internal improvements was the Tariff of 1824.[27] Sponsored by Henry Clay, this tariff provided a general level of protection at 35% ad valorem (compared to 25% with the 1816 act) and hiked duties on iron, woolens, cotton, hemp, and wool and cotton bagging. The bill barely passed the federal House of Representatives by a vote of 107 to 102. The Middle states and Northwest supported the bill, the South and Southwest opposed it, and New England split its vote with a majority opposing it. In the Senate, the bill, with the support of Tennessee Senator Andrew Jackson, passed by four votes, and President James Monroe, the Virginia heir to the Jefferson-Madison control of the White House, signed the bill on March 25, 1824.[28] Daniel Webster of Massachusetts led the New England opposition to this tariff.[29]\n",
    "\n",
    "Protest against the prospect and the constitutionality of higher tariffs began in 1826 and 1827 with William Branch Giles, who had the Virginia legislature pass resolutions denying the power of Congress to pass protective tariffs, citing the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 and James Madison's 1800 defense of them. Madison denied both the appeal to nullification and the unconstitutionality; he had always held that the power to regulate commerce included protection. Jefferson had, at the end of his life, written against protective tariffs.[30]\n",
    "Portrait of Martin Van Buren\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tariff of 1828 was largely the work of Martin Van Buren (although Silas Wright Jr. of New York prepared the main provisions) and was partly a political ploy to elect Andrew Jackson President. Van Buren calculated that the South would vote for Jackson regardless of the issues, so he ignored their interests in drafting the bill. New England, he thought, was just as likely to support the incumbent John Quincy Adams, so the bill levied heavy taxes on raw materials consumed by New England such as hemp, flax, molasses, iron, and sail duck. With an additional tariff on iron to satisfy Pennsylvania interests, Van Buren expected the tariff to help deliver Pennsylvania, New York, Missouri, Ohio, and Kentucky to Jackson. Over opposition from the South and some from New England, the tariff was passed with the full support of many Jackson supporters in Congress and signed by President Adams in early 1828.[31]\n",
    "\n",
    "As expected, Jackson and his running mate John Calhoun carried the entire South with overwhelming numbers in every state but Louisiana, where Adams drew 47% of the vote in a losing effort. But many Southerners became dissatisfied as Jackson, in his first two annual messages to Congress, failed to launch a strong attack on the tariff. Historian William J. Cooper Jr. writes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The most doctrinaire ideologues of the Old Republican group [supporters of the Jefferson and Madison position in the late 1790s] first found Jackson wanting. These purists identified the tariff of 1828, the hated Tariff of Abominations, as the most heinous manifestation of the nationalist policy they abhorred. That protective tariff violated their constitutional theory, for, as they interpreted the document, it gave no permission for a protective tariff. Moreover, they saw protection as benefiting the North and hurting the South.[32]\n",
    "\n",
    "South Carolina background (1819–1828)\n",
    "John C. Calhoun\n",
    "\n",
    "South Carolina had been adversely affected by the national economic decline of the 1820s. During this decade, the population decreased by 56,000 whites and 30,000 slaves, out of a total free and slave population of 580,000. The whites left for better places; they took slaves with them or sold them to traders moving slaves to the Deep South for sale.[33]\n",
    "\n",
    "Historian Richard E. Ellis describes the situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Throughout the colonial and early national periods, South Carolina had sustained substantial economic growth and prosperity. This had created an extremely wealthy and extravagant low country aristocracy whose fortunes were based first on the cultivation of rice and indigo, and then on cotton. Then the state was devastated by the Panic of 1819. The depression that followed was more severe than in almost any other state of the Union. Moreover, competition from the newer cotton producing areas along the Gulf Coast, blessed with fertile lands that produced a higher crop-yield per acre, made recovery painfully slow. To make matters worse, in large areas of South Carolina slaves vastly outnumbered whites, and there existed both considerable fear of slave rebellion and a growing sensitivity to even the smallest criticism of \"the peculiar institution.\"[34]\n",
    "\n",
    "George McDuffie\n",
    "\n",
    "State leaders, led by states' rights advocates such as William Smith and Thomas Cooper, blamed most of the state's economic problems on the Tariff of 1816 and national internal improvement projects. Soil erosion and competition from the New Southwest were also very significant reasons for the state's declining fortunes.[35] George McDuffie was a particularly effective speaker for the anti-tariff forces, and he popularized the Forty Bale theory. McDuffie argued that the 40% tariff on cotton finished goods meant that \"the manufacturer actually invades your barns, and plunders you of 40 out of every 100 bales that you produce.\" Mathematically incorrect, this argument still struck a nerve with his constituency. Nationalists such as Calhoun were forced by the increasing power of such leaders to retreat from their previous positions and adopt, in the words of Ellis, \"an even more extreme version of the states' rights doctrine\" in order to maintain political significance within South Carolina.[36]\n",
    "Thomas Bee's House, Charleston, circa 1730: The Nullification Movement that split the nation started here in 1832. John C. Calhoun, S.C. Governor Robert Hayne, General James Hamilton and other leaders drafted the Nullification Papers in the second-floor drawing room.\n",
    "\n",
    "South Carolina's first effort at nullification occurred in 1822. Its planter class believed that free black sailors had assisted Denmark Vesey in his planned slave rebellion. South Carolina passed the Negro Seamen Act, which required all black foreign seamen to be imprisoned while their ships were docked in Charleston. The United Kingdom strongly objected, especially as it was recruiting more Africans as sailors. Worse, if the captains did not pay the fees to cover the cost of jailing, South Carolina would sell the sailors into slavery. Other Southern states also passed laws against free black sailors.[37]\n",
    "\n",
    "Supreme Court Justice William Johnson, in his capacity as a circuit judge, declared the South Carolina law as unconstitutional since it violated the United States' treaties with the United Kingdom. The South Carolina Senate announced that the judge's ruling was invalid and that the act would be enforced. The federal government did not attempt to carry out Johnson's decision.[38]\n",
    "Route to nullification in South Carolina (1828–1832)\n",
    "Joel Roberts Poinsett, South Carolina Unionist leader\n",
    "\n",
    "Historian Avery Craven argues that, for the most part, the debate from 1828 to 1832 was a local South Carolina affair. The state's leaders were not united and the sides were roughly equal. The western part of the state and a faction in Charleston, led by Joel Poinsett and Thomas Smith Grimké, remained loyal to the Union. Only in small part was the conflict between \"a National North against a States'-right South\".[39]\n",
    "\n",
    "After the final vote on the Tariff of 1828, South Carolina's congressional delegation held two caucuses, the second at the home of Senator Robert Y. Hayne. They were rebuffed in their efforts to coordinate a united Southern response and focused on how their state representatives would react. While many agreed with McDuffie that tariff policy could lead to secession, they all agreed that, as much as possible, the issue should be kept out of the upcoming presidential election. Calhoun, while not at this meeting, served as a moderating influence. He felt that the first step in reducing the tariff was to defeat Adams and his supporters in the upcoming election. William C. Preston, on behalf of the South Carolina legislature, asked Calhoun to prepare a report on the tariff situation. Calhoun readily accepted and in a few weeks had a 35,000-word draft of what would become his \"Exposition and Protest\".[40]\n",
    "\n",
    "Calhoun's \"Exposition\" was completed late in 1828. He argued that the tariff of 1828 was unconstitutional because it favored manufacturing over commerce and agriculture. He believed the tariff power could be used only to generate revenue, not to provide protection from foreign competition for American industries, and that the people of a state or several states, acting in a democratically elected convention, had the power to veto any act of the federal government that violated the Constitution. This veto, the core of the doctrine of nullification, was explained by Calhoun in the Exposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "    If it be conceded, as it must be by every one who is the least conversant with our institutions, that the sovereign powers delegated are divided between the General and State Governments, and that the latter hold their portion by the same tenure as the former, it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.[41]\n",
    "\n",
    "The report also detailed the specific southern grievances over the tariff that led to the current dissatisfaction.[42] Fearful that \"hotheads\" such as McDuffie might force the legislature into taking drastic action against the federal government, historian John Niven describes Calhoun's political purpose in the document:\n",

    "    All through that hot and humid summer, emotions among the vociferous planter population had been worked up to a near-frenzy of excitement. The whole tenor of the argument built up in the \"Exposition\" was aimed to present the case in a cool, considered manner that would dampen any drastic moves yet would set in motion the machinery for repeal of the tariff act. It would also warn other sections of the Union against any future legislation that an increasingly self-conscious South might consider punitive, especially on the subject of slavery.[43]\n",
    "\n",
    "The report was submitted to the state legislature, which had 5,000 copies printed and distributed. Calhoun, who still had designs on succeeding Jackson as president, was not identified as the author, but word on this soon leaked out. The legislature took no action on the report at that time.[44]\n",
    "\n",
    "In the summer of 1828, Robert Barnwell Rhett, soon to be considered the most radical of the South Carolinians, entered the fray over the tariff. As a state representative, Rhett called for the governor to convene a special session of the legislature. An outstanding orator, Rhett appealed to his constituents to resist the majority in Congress. He addressed the danger of doing nothing:\n",
    "\n",
    "    But if you are doubtful of yourselves—if you are not prepared to follow up your principles wherever they may lead, to their very last consequence—if you love life better than honor,—prefer ease to perilous liberty and glory; awake not! Stir not!—Impotent resistance will add vengeance to your ruin. Live in smiling peace with your insatiable Oppressors, and die with the noble consolation that your submissive patience will survive triumphant your beggary and despair.[45]\n",
    "\n",
    "Rhett's rhetoric about revolution and war was too radical in the summer of 1828 but, with the election of Jackson assured, James Hamilton Jr. on October 28 in the Colleton County Courthouse in Walterborough \"launched the formal nullification campaign.\"[46] Renouncing his former nationalism, Hamilton warned the people that \"Your task-master must soon become a tyrant, from the very abuses and corruption of the system, without the bowels of compassion, or a jot of human sympathy.\" He called for implementation of Jefferson's \"rightful remedy\" of nullification. Hamilton sent a copy of the speech directly to President-elect Jackson. But despite a statewide campaign by Hamilton and McDuffie, a proposal to call a nullification convention in 1829 was defeated by the South Carolina legislature meeting at the end of 1828. State leaders such as Calhoun, Hayne, Smith, and William Drayton all remained publicly noncommittal or opposed to nullification for the next couple of years.[47]\n",
    "\n",
    "The division in the state between radicals and conservatives continued through 1829 and 1830. After the failure of a state project to arrange financing of a railroad within the state to promote internal trade, the state petitioned Congress to invest $250,000 in the company trying to build it. After Congress tabled the measure, debate in South Carolina resumed between those who wanted state investment and those who wanted to work to get Congress's support. The debate demonstrated that a significant minority of the state did have an interest in Clay's American System. The effect of the Webster–Hayne debate was to energize the radicals, and some moderates started to move in their direction.[48]\n",
    "\n",
    "The state election campaign of 1830 focused on the tariff issue and the need for a state convention. On the defensive, radicals underplayed the intent of the convention as pro-nullification. When voters were presented with races where an unpledged convention was the issue, the radicals generally won. When conservatives effectively characterized the race as being about nullification, the radicals lost. The October election was narrowly carried by the radicals, although the blurring of the issues left them without any specific mandate.[49] In South Carolina, the governor was selected by the legislature, which chose James Hamilton, the leader of the radical movement, and fellow radical Henry L. Pinckney as speaker of the South Carolina House. For the open Senate seat, the legislature chose the more radical Stephen Decatur Miller over William Smith.[50]\n",
    "\n",
    "With radicals in leading positions, in 1831 they began to capture momentum. State politics became sharply divided along Nullifier and Unionist lines. Still, the margin in the legislature fell short of the two-thirds majority needed for a convention. Many of the radicals felt that convincing Calhoun of the futility of his plans for the presidency would lead him into their ranks. Calhoun, meanwhile, had concluded that Van Buren was establishing himself as Jackson's heir apparent. At Hamilton's prompting, McDuffie made a three-hour speech in Charleston demanding nullification of the tariff at any cost. In the state, the success of McDuffie's speech seemed to open up the possibilities of both military confrontation with the federal government and civil war within the state. With silence no longer an acceptable alternative, Calhoun looked for the opportunity to take control of the antitariff faction in the state; by June he was preparing what would be known as his Fort Hill Address.[51]\n",
    "\n",
    "Published on July 26, 1831, the address repeated and expanded the positions Calhoun had made in the \"Exposition\". While the logic of much of the speech was consistent with the states' rights position of most Jacksonians, and even Daniel Webster remarked that it \"was the ablest and most plausible, and therefore the most dangerous vindication of that particular form of Revolution\", the speech still placed Calhoun clearly in a nullified camp. Within South Carolina, his gestures at moderation in the speech were drowned out as planters received word of the Nat Turner insurrection in Virginia. Calhoun was not alone in finding a connection between the abolition movement and the sectional aspects of the tariff issue.[52] It confirmed for Calhoun what he had written in a September 11, 1830, letter:\n",
    "\n",
    "    I consider the tariff act as the occasion, rather than the real cause of the present unhappy state of things. The truth can no longer be disguised, that the peculiar institution of the Southern States and the consequent direction which that and her soil have given to her industry, has placed them in regard to taxation and appropriations in opposite relation to the majority of the Union, against the danger of which, if there be no protective power in the reserved rights of the states they must in the end be forced to rebel, or, submit to have their paramount interests sacrificed, their domestic institutions subordinated by Colonization and other schemes, and themselves and children reduced to wretchedness.[53]\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point, the nullifiers accelerated their organization and rhetoric. In July 1831, the States Rights and Free Trade Association was formed in Charleston and expanded throughout the state. Unlike state political organizations in the past, which were led by the South Carolina planter aristocracy, this group appealed to all segments of the population, including non-slaveholder farmers, small slaveholders, and the Charleston non-agricultural class. Governor Hamilton was instrumental in seeing that the association, which was both a political and a social organization, expanded throughout the state. In the winter of 1831 and spring of 1832, Hamilton held conventions and rallies throughout the state to mobilize the nullification movement. The conservatives were unable to match the radicals in organization or leadership.[54]\n",
    "\n",
    "The state elections of 1832 were \"charged with tension and bespattered with violence,\" and \"polite debates often degenerated into frontier brawls.\" Unlike the previous year's election, the choice was clear between nullifiers and unionists. The nullifiers won and on October 20, 1832, Hamilton called the legislature into a special session to consider a convention. The legislative vote was 96–25 in the House and 31–13 in the Senate.[55]\n",
    "\n",
    "In November 1832, the Nullification Convention met. The convention declared the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 unconstitutional and unenforceable within the state of South Carolina after February 1, 1833. It was asserted that attempts to use force to collect the taxes would lead to the state's secession. Robert Hayne, who succeeded Hamilton as governor in 1833, established a 2,000-man group of mounted minutemen and 25,000 infantry who would march to Charleston in the event of a military conflict. These troops were to be armed with $100,000 in arms purchased in the North.[56]\n",
    "\n",
    "The enabling legislation passed by the legislature was carefully constructed to avoid clashes if at all possible and create an aura of legality in the process. To avoid conflicts with Unionists, it allowed importers to pay the tariff if they desired. Other merchants could pay the tariff by obtaining a paper tariff bond from the customs officer. They would then refuse to pay the bond when due, and if the customs official seized the goods, the merchant would file for a writ of replevin to recover the goods in state court. Customs officials who refused to return the goods (by placing them under the protection of federal troops) would be civilly liable for twice the value of the goods. To ensure that state officials and judges supported the law, a \"test oath\" would be required for all new state officials, binding them to support the ordinance of nullification.[57]\n",
    "\n",
    "Governor Hayne in his inaugural address announced South Carolina's position:\n",
    "\n",
    "    If the sacred soil of Carolina should be polluted by the footsteps of an invader, or be stained with the blood of her citizens, shed in defense, I trust in Almighty God that no son of hers ... who has been nourished at her bosom ... will be found raising a parricidal arm against our common mother. And even should she stand ALONE in this great struggle for constitutional liberty ... that there will not be found, in the wider limits of the state, one recreant son who will not fly to the rescue, and be ready to lay down his life in her defense.[58]\n",

    "When President Jackson took office in March 1829, he was well aware of the turmoil created by the \"Tariff of Abominations\". While he may have abandoned some of his earlier beliefs that had allowed him to vote for the Tariff of 1824, he still felt protectionism was justified for products essential to military preparedness and did not believe that the current tariff should be reduced until the national debt was fully paid off. He addressed the issue in his inaugural address and his first three messages to Congress, but offered no specific relief. In December 1831, with the proponents of nullification in South Carolina gaining momentum, Jackson recommended \"the exercise of that spirit of concession and conciliation which has distinguished the friends of our Union in all great emergencies.\"[59] But on the constitutional issue of nullification, despite his strong beliefs in states' rights, Jackson did not waver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calhoun's \"Exposition and Protest\" started a national debate on the doctrine of nullification. The leading proponents[60] of the nationalistic view included Daniel Webster, Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, Judge William Alexander Duer, John Quincy Adams, Nathaniel Chipman, and Nathan Dane. They rejected the compact theory advanced by Calhoun, claiming that the Constitution was the product of the people, not the states. According to the nationalist position, the Supreme Court had the final say on legislation's constitutionality, and the national union was perpetual and had supreme authority over individual states.[61] The nullifiers, on the other hand, asserted that the central government was not the ultimate arbiter of its own power, and that the states, as the contracting entities, could judge for themselves what was constitutional. While Calhoun's \"Exposition\" claimed that nullification was based on the reasoning behind the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, an aging James Madison in an August 28, 1830, letter to Edward Everett, intended for publication, disagreed. Madison wrote, denying that any individual state could alter the compact:[62]\n",
    "\n",
    "    Can more be necessary to demonstrate the inadmissibility of such a doctrine than that it puts it in the power of the smallest fraction over 1/4 of the U. S.—that is, of 7 States out of 24—to give the law and even the Constn. to 17 States, each of the 17 having as parties to the Constn. an equal right with each of the 7 to expound it & to insist on the exposition. That the 7 might, in particular instances be right and the 17 wrong, is more than possible. But to establish a positive & permanent rule giving such a power to such a minority over such a majority, would overturn the first principle of free Govt. and in practice necessarily overturn the Govt. itself.[63]\n",
    "\n",
    "Webster Replying to Hayne by George P.A. Healy\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the South's strategy to force repeal of the tariff was to arrange an alliance with the West. Under the plan, the South would support the West's demand for free lands in the public domain if the West supported repeal of the tariff. With this purpose, Robert Hayne took the floor on the Senate in early 1830, beginning \"the most celebrated debate in the Senate's history.\" Daniel Webster's response shifted the debate, subsequently styled the Webster-Hayne debates, from the specific issue of western lands to a general debate on the very nature of the United States. Webster's position differed from Madison's: Webster asserted that the people of the United States acted as one aggregate body, while Madison held that the people of the several states acted collectively. John Rowan spoke against Webster on that issue, and Madison wrote, congratulating Webster, but explaining his own position.[64] The debate presented the fullest articulation of the differences over nullification, and 40,000 copies of Webster's response, which concluded with \"liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable\", were distributed nationwide.[65]\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people expected Jackson to side with Hayne, but once the debate shifted to secession and nullification, he sided with Webster. On April 13, 1830, at the traditional Democratic Party celebration honoring Jefferson's birthday, Jackson chose to make his position clear. In a battle of toasts, Hayne proposed, \"The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States.\" Jackson's response, when his turn came, was, \"Our Federal Union: It must be preserved.\" To those attending, the effect was dramatic. Calhoun responded with his own toast, in a play on Webster's closing remarks in the earlier debate, \"The Union. Next to our liberty, the most dear.\" Finally, Van Buren offered, \"Mutual forbearance and reciprocal concession. Through their agency the Union was established. The patriotic spirit from which they emanated will forever sustain it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Van Buren wrote in his autobiography of Jackson's toast, \"The veil was rent—the incantations of the night were exposed to the light of day.\" Senator Thomas Hart Benton, in his memoirs, wrote that the toast \"electrified the country.\"[66] Jackson had the final word a few days later, when a visitor from South Carolina asked if Jackson had any message he wanted relayed to his friends back in the state. Jackson's reply was:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Yes I have; please give my compliments to my friends in your State and say to them, that if a single drop of blood shall be shed there in opposition to the laws of the United States, I will hang the first man I can lay my hand on engaged in such treasonable conduct, upon the first tree I can reach.[67]\n",
    "\n",
    "Other issues than the tariff were still being decided. In May 1830, Jackson vetoed the Maysville Road Bill, an important internal-improvements program (especially to Kentucky and Henry Clay), and then followed this with additional vetoes of other such projects shortly before Congress adjourned at the end of May. Clay used these vetoes to launch his presidential campaign.[68] In 1831, the rechartering of the Bank of the United States, with Clay and Jackson on opposite sides, reopened a long-simmering problem. This issue was featured at the December 1831 National Republican convention in Baltimore, which nominated Clay for president, and the proposal to recharter was formally introduced into Congress on January 6, 1832.[69] The Calhoun-Jackson split entered the center stage when Calhoun, as vice president presiding over the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote to deny Van Buren the post of minister to England. Van Buren was subsequently selected as Jackson's running mate at the 1832 Democratic National Convention held in May.[70]\n",
    "Portrait of Henry Clay\n",
    "\n",
    "In February 1832, Clay, back in the Senate after a two-decade absence, made a three-day speech calling for a new tariff schedule and an expansion of his American System. In an effort to reach out to Calhoun and other Southerners, Clay's proposal provided for a $10 million revenue reduction based on the budget surplus he anticipated for the coming year. Significant protection was still part of the plan, as the reduction primarily came on imports not in competition with domestic producers. Jackson proposed an alternative that reduced overall tariffs to 28%. John Quincy Adams, now in the House of Representatives, used his Committee of Manufacturers to produce a compromise bill that, in its final form, reduced revenues by $5 million, lowered duties on noncompetitive products, and retained high tariffs on woolens, iron, and cotton products. During the political maneuvering, McDuffie's Ways and Means Committee, the normal originator of such bills, prepared a bill with drastic reduction across the board, but it went nowhere. Jackson signed the Tariff of 1832 on July 14, 1832, a few days after vetoing the Bank of the United States recharter bill. Congress adjourned after failing to override Jackson's veto.[71]\n",
    "\n",
    "With Congress adjourned, Jackson anxiously watched events in South Carolina. The nullifiers found no significant compromise in the Tariff of 1832 and acted accordingly. Jackson heard rumors of efforts to subvert members of the army and navy in Charleston and ordered the secretaries of the army and navy to begin rotating troops and officers based on their loyalty. He ordered General Winfield Scott to prepare for military operations and ordered a naval squadron in Norfolk to prepare to go to Charleston. Jackson kept lines of communication open with unionists such as Joel Poinsett, William Drayton, and James L. Petigru and sent George Breathitt, brother of the Kentucky governor, to independently obtain political and military intelligence. After their defeat at the polls in October, Petigru advised Jackson to \"Be prepared to hear very shortly of a State Convention and an act of Nullification.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "On October 29, 1832, Jackson wrote to his Secretary of War, Lewis Cass:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The attempt will be made to surprise the Forts & garrisons by the militia, and must be guarded against with vestal vigilance and any attempt by force repelled with prompt and exemplary punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "By mid-November, Jackson's reelection was assured.[72] On December 3, 1832, Jackson sent his fourth annual message to Congress. The message \"was stridently states' rights and agrarian in its tone and thrust\" and disavowed protection as anything other than a temporary expedient.[73] His intent regarding nullification, as communicated to Van Buren, was \"to pass it barely in review, as a mere buble [sic], view the existing laws as competent to check and put it down.\" He hoped to create a \"moral force\" that would transcend political parties and sections. The paragraph in the message that addressed nullification was:\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is my painful duty to state that in one quarter of the United States opposition to the revenue laws has arisen to a height which threatens to thwart their execution, if not to endanger the integrity of the Union. What ever obstructions may be thrown in the way of the judicial authorities of the General Government, it is hoped they will be able peaceably to overcome them by the prudence of their own officers and the patriotism of the people. But should this reasonable reliance on the moderation and good sense of all portions of our fellow citizens be disappointed, it is believed that the laws themselves are fully adequate to the suppression of such attempts as may be immediately made. Should the exigency arise rendering the execution of the existing laws impracticable from any cause what ever, prompt notice of it will be given to Congress, with a suggestion of such views and measures as may be deemed necessary to meet it.[74]\n",
    "\n",
    "On December 10, Jackson issued the Proclamation to the People of South Carolina, in which he characterized the positions of the nullifiers as \"impractical absurdity\" and \"a metaphysical subtlety, in pursuit of an impractical theory.\" He provided this concise statement of his belief:\n",
    "\n",
    "    I consider, then, the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which It was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.[75]\n",
    "\n",
    "The language Jackson used, combined with the reports out of South Carolina, raised the spectre of military confrontation for many on both sides of the issue. A group of Democrats, led by Van Buren and Thomas Hart Benton, among others, saw the only solution to the crisis in a substantial reduction of the tariff.\n",
    "Negotiation and confrontation (1833)\n",
    "\n",
    "In apparent contradiction of his previous claim that the tariff could be enforced with existing laws, on January 16 Jackson sent his Force Bill Message to Congress. Custom houses in Beaufort and Georgetown would be closed and replaced by ships at each port. In Charleston, the custom house would be moved to either Castle Pinckney or Fort Moultrie in Charleston Harbor. Direct payment rather than bonds would be required, and federal jails would be established for violators the state refused to arrest and all cases arising under the state's nullification act could be removed to the United States Circuit Court. In the most controversial part, the militia acts of 1795 and 1807 would be revised to permit the enforcement of the customs laws by both the militia and the regular United States military. Attempts were made in South Carolina to shift the debate away from nullification by focusing instead on the proposed enforcement.[76]\n",
    "\n",
    "The Force bill went to the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Pennsylvania protectionist William Wilkins and supported by members Daniel Webster and Theodore Frelinghuysen of New Jersey; it gave Jackson everything he asked. On January 28, the Senate defeated a motion by a vote of 30 to 15 to postpone debate on the bill. All but two of the votes to delay were from the lower South and only three from this section voted against the motion. This did not signal any increased support for nullification, but did signify doubts about enforcement. To draw more votes, proposals were made to limit the duration of the coercive powers and restrict the use of force to suppressing, rather than preventing, civil disorder. In the House, the Judiciary Committee voted 4–3 to reject Jackson's request to use force. By the time Calhoun made a major speech on February 15 strongly opposing it, the Force Bill was temporarily stalled.[77]\n",
    "\n",
    "On the tariff issue, the drafting of a compromise tariff was assigned in December to the House Ways and Means Committee, now headed by Gulian C. Verplanck. Debate on the committee's product on the House floor began in January 1833. The Verplanck tariff proposed reductions back to 1816 levels over the next two years while maintaining the basic principle of protectionism. The anti-Jackson protectionists saw this as an economic disaster that did not even allow the Tariff of 1832 to be tested and \"an undignified truckling to the menaces and blustering of South Carolina.\" Northern Democrats did not oppose it in principle, but still demanded protection for the varying interests of their own constituents. Those sympathetic to the nullifiers wanted a specific abandonment of the principle of protectionism and were willing to offer a longer transition period as a bargaining point. The Verplanck tariff was clearly not going to be implemented.[78]\n",
    "\n",
    "In South Carolina, efforts were being made to avoid an unnecessary confrontation. Governor Hayne ordered the 25,000 troops he had created to train at home rather than gather in Charleston. At a mass meeting in Charleston on January 21, they decided to postpone the February 1 deadline for implementing nullification, while Congress worked on a compromise tariff. At the same time, a commissioner from Virginia, Benjamin W. Leigh, arrived in Charleston bearing resolutions that criticized both Jackson and the nullifiers and offering his state as a mediator.[79]\n",
    "\n",
    "Clay had not taken his defeat in the presidential election well and was unsure what position he could take in the tariff negotiations. His long-term concern was that Jackson was determined to kill protectionism along with the American Plan. In February, after consulting with manufacturers and sugar interests in Louisiana, who favored protection for the sugar industry, Clay started to work on a specific compromise plan. As a starting point, he accepted the nullifiers' offer of a transition period, but extended it from seven and a half years to nine years with a final target of a 20% ad valorem rate. After first securing the support of his protectionist base, Clay, through an intermediary, broached the subject with Calhoun. Calhoun was receptive, and after a private meeting with Clay at Clay's boardinghouse, negotiations proceeded.[80]\n",
    "\n",
    "Clay introduced the negotiated tariff bill on February 12, and it was immediately referred to a select committee consisting of Clay as chairman, Felix Grundy of Tennessee, George M. Dallas of Pennsylvania, William Cabell Rives of Virginia, Webster, John M. Clayton of Delaware, and Calhoun. On February 21, the committee reported a bill to the floor of the Senate that was largely Clay's original bill. The Tariff of 1832 would continue except that reduction of all rates above 20% would be reduced by one tenth every two years, with the final reductions back to 20% coming in 1842. Protectionism as a principle was not abandoned and provisions were made for raising the tariff if national interests demanded it.[81]\n",
    "\n",
    "Although not specifically linked by any negotiated agreement, it became clear that the Force Bill and Compromise Tariff of 1833 were inexorably linked. In his February 25 speech ending the debate on the tariff, Clay captured the spirit of the voices for compromise by condemning Jackson's Proclamation to South Carolina as inflammatory, admitting the same problem with the Force Bill, but indicating its necessity, and praising the Compromise Tariff as the final measure to restore balance, promote the rule of law, and avoid the \"sacked cities\", \"desolated fields\", and \"smoking ruins\" he said the failure to reach a final accord would produce. The House passed the Compromise Tariff, 119–85, and the Force Bill, 149–48. In the Senate, the tariff passed 29–16 and the Force bill 32–1, with many opponents of it walking out rather than voting.[82]\n",
    "\n",
    "Calhoun rushed to Charleston with the news of the final compromises. The Nullification Convention met again on March 11. It repealed the November Nullification Ordinance and also, \"in a purely symbolic gesture\", nullified the Force Bill. While the nullifiers claimed victory on the tariff issue, even though they had made concessions, the verdict was very different on nullification. The majority had in the end ruled and this boded ill for the South and its minority's hold on slavery.[83] Rhett summed this up at the convention on March 13. Warning that \"A people, owning slaves, are mad, or worse than mad, who do not hold their destinies in their own hands,\" he continued:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Every stride of this Government, over your rights, brings it nearer and nearer to your peculiar policy. ... The whole world are in arms against your institutions ... Let Gentlemen not be deceived. It is not the Tariff—not Internal Improvement—nor yet the Force bill, which constitutes the great evil against which we are contending. ... These are but the forms in which the despotic nature of the government is evinced—but it is the despotism which constitutes the evil: and until this Government is made a limited Government ... there is no liberty—no security for the South.[84]\n",
    "\n",
    "Aftermath\n",
    "\n",
    "People reflected on the meaning of the nullification crisis and its outcome for the country. On May 1, 1833, Jackson predicted, \"the tariff was only a pretext, and disunion and Southern confederacy the real object. The next pretext will be the negro, or slavery question.\"[85]\n",
    "\n",
    "The final resolution of the crisis and Jackson's leadership had appeal throughout the North and South. Robert V. Remini, the historian and Jackson biographer, described the opposition that nullification drew from traditionally states' rights Southern states:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Alabama legislature, for example, pronounced the doctrine \"unsound in theory and dangerous in practice.\" Georgia said it was \"mischievous\", \"rash and revolutionary\". Mississippi lawmakers chided the South Carolinians for acting with \"reckless precipitancy\".[86]\n",
    "\n",
    "The historian Forrest McDonald, describing the split over nullification among proponents of states' rights, wrote, \"The doctrine of states' rights, as embraced by most Americans, was not concerned exclusively, or even primarily, with state resistance to federal authority.\"[87] But by the end of the nullification crisis, many Southerners questioned whether Jacksonian Democrats still represented Southern interests. The historian William J. Cooper Jr. notes, \"Numerous Southerners had begun to perceive it [the Jacksonian Democratic Party] as a spear aimed at the South rather than a shield defending the South.\"[88]\n",
    "\n",
    "In the political vacuum created by this alienation, the Southern wing of the Whig Party was formed. The party was a coalition of interests united by the common thread of opposition to Jackson, and more specifically to his \"definition of federal and executive power.\" The party included former National Republicans with an \"urban, commercial, and nationalist outlook\", as well as former nullifiers. Emphasizing that \"they were more southern than the Democrats,\" the party grew within the South by going \"after the abolition issue with unabashed vigor and glee.\" With both parties arguing who could best defend Southern institutions, the nuances of the differences between free soil and abolitionism, which became an issue in the late 1840s with the Mexican War and territorial expansion, never became part of the political dialogue. This failure increased the slavery issue's volatility.[88]\n",
    "\n",
    "Richard Ellis argues that the end of the crisis signified the beginning of a new era. Within the states' rights movement, the traditional desire for \"a weak, inactive, and frugal government\" was challenged. Ellis writes, \"in the years leading up to the Civil War the nullifiers and their proslavery allies used the doctrine of states' rights and state sovereignty in such a way as to try to expand the powers of the federal government so that it could more effectively protect the peculiar institution.\" By the 1850s, states' rights had become a call for state equality under the Constitution.[89]\n",
    "\n",
    "Madison reacted to this incipient tendency by writing two paragraphs of \"Advice to My Country\", found among his papers. It said that the Union \"should be cherished and perpetuated. Let the open enemy to it be regarded as a Pandora with her box opened; and the disguised one, as the Serpent creeping with his deadly wiles into paradise.\" Richard Rush published this \"Advice\" in 1850, by which time Southern spirit was so high that it was denounced as a forgery.[90]\n",
    "\n",
    "The first test for the South over slavery began during the final congressional session of 1835. In what became known as the Gag Rule Debates, abolitionists flooded Congress with petitions to end slavery in the District of Columbia, where states' rights was not an issue. The debate was reopened each session as Southerners, led by South Carolinians Henry Pinckney and John Hammond, prevented the petitions from even being officially received by Congress. Led by John Quincy Adams, the slavery debate remained on the national stage until late 1844, when Congress lifted all restrictions on processing the petitions.[91]\n",
    "\n",
    "Describing the legacy of the crisis, Sean Wilentz writes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The battle between Jacksonian democratic nationalists, northern and southern, and nullifier sectionalists would resound through the politics of slavery and antislavery for decades to come. Jackson's victory, ironically, would help accelerate the emergence of southern pro-slavery as a coherent and articulate political force, which would help solidify northern antislavery opinion, inside as well as outside Jackson's party.

    "For South Carolina, the legacy of the crisis involved both the divisions within the state during the crisis and the apparent isolation of the state as the crisis was resolved. By 1860, when it became the first state to secede, it was more internally united than any other Southern state. Historian Charles Edward Cauthen writes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Probably to a greater extent than in any other Southern state South Carolina had been prepared by her leaders over a period of thirty years for the issues of 1860. Indoctrination in the principles of state sovereignty, education in the necessity of maintaining Southern institutions, warnings of the dangers of control of the federal government by a section hostile to its interests—in a word, the education of the masses in the principles and necessity of secession under certain circumstances—had been carried on with a skill and success hardly inferior to the masterly propaganda of the abolitionists themselves. It was this education, this propaganda, by South Carolina leaders which made secession the almost spontaneous movement that it was.[92]\n",

    "Kendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper and songwriter. Regarded as one of the most influential hip-hop artists of his generation, and one of the greatest rappers of all time, he is known for his technical artistry and complex songwriting. He was awarded the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Music, becoming the first musician outside of the classical and jazz genres to receive the honor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lamar began releasing music under the stage name K.Dot while he was attending high school. He signed with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) in 2005, where he co-founded the hip hop supergroup Black Hippy. Following the success of his alternative rap debut album Section.80 (2011), Lamar secured a joint contract with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. He rose to prominence with his gangsta rap-influenced second album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012), which became the longest-charting hip hop studio album in the Billboard 200's chart history; Rolling Stone named it the greatest concept album of all time. Lamar's third album, To Pimp a Butterfly (2015), infused hip-hop with historical African-American music genres such as jazz, funk and soul. It became his first of five consecutive number-one albums on the Billboard 200 chart, and was one of the most critically acclaimed albums of the 2010s.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2015, Lamar garnered his first number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100, after featuring on the remix of Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood\". His critical and commercial success continued with his R&B and pop-leaning fourth album Damn (2017), yielding his second Hot 100 number-one single, \"Humble\". He curated original songs for the soundtrack album of the 2018 film Black Panther, earning a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the US and UK top-ten single \"All the Stars\" (with SZA). Lamar's 2022 double album Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers concluded his tenure with TDE and Aftermath. His feud with Drake and sixth album GNX (2024) spawned the Hot 100 number-ones \"Like That\", \"Not Like Us\" and \"Squabble Up\".\n",

    "Lamar has received various accolades throughout his career, including 17 Grammy Awards (the third-most won by a rapper), a Primetime Emmy Award, a Brit Award, four American Music Awards, six Billboard Music Awards, 11 MTV Video Music Awards (including two Video of the Year wins) and 37 BET Hip Hop Awards (the most won by any artist). Time listed him as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2016. Two of his concert tours, the Damn Tour (2017–2018) and the Big Steppers Tour (2022–2024), are amongst the highest-grossing rap tours in history. Three of his works were included in Rolling Stone's 2020 revision of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

    "Early life\n",
    "\n",
    "Kendrick Lamar Duckworth was born on June 17, 1987, in Compton, California.[2] He is the first child of former gang hustler Kenneth \"Kenny\" Duckworth and hairdresser Paula Oliver.[3] Both of his parents are African Americans from the South Side of Chicago.[3] When they were teenagers, they relocated to Compton in 1984, due to his father's affiliation with the Gangster Disciples.[4] Lamar was named after singer-songwriter Eddie Kendricks of the Temptations.[5] He was an only child until the age of seven and was described as a loner by his mother.[3][6] Eventually, his parents had his two younger brothers and younger sister, businesswoman Kayla Sawyer (née Duckworth).[7] His cousins include basketball player Nick Young and rapper Baby Keem.[8][9]\n",
    "\n",
    "Lamar and his family lived in Section 8 housing, were reliant on welfare and food stamps, and experienced homelessness.[10][11] Although he is not a member of a particular gang, he grew up with close affiliates of the Westside Pirus.[4] Despite suffering hardships, Lamar remembered having \"good memories\" of his childhood that sparked his interest in hip hop music, such as sneaking into his parents' house parties.[3][12] He was raised secular, although he occasionally attended church services and was taught the Bible by his grandmother.[13] He felt \"spiritually unsatisfied\" as a child due to the \"empty\" and \"one-sided\" nature of the sermons.[14]\n",
    "Lamar experienced the 1992 Los Angeles riots during his childhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "After hearing a recording of his voice for the first time, Lamar became interested in rapping.[15] He was introduced to police brutality after experiencing the first day of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.[3] When he was five years old, he witnessed a murder for the first time while sitting outside of his apartment unit, as a teenage drug dealer was killed in a drive-by shooting.[3] \"It done [sic] something to me right then and there,\" Lamar later admitted to NPR Music. \"It let me know that this is not only something that I'm looking at, but it's something that maybe I have to get used to.\"[16] His parents nicknamed him \"Man-Man\" due to his precocious behavior, although he confessed it \"put a stigma on the idea of me reacting as a kid sometimes—I would hurt myself and they would expect me not to cry.\"[17]\n",
    "\n",
    "In school, Lamar was a quiet and observant student who excelled academically and had a noticeable stutter.[18] His first grade teacher at Robert E. McNair Elementary School encouraged him to become a writer after she heard him correctly use the word \"audacity\".[19] As a seventh grade student at Vanguard Learning Center, Lamar was introduced to poetry by his English teacher, Regis Inge.[20] Inge integrated the literary form into his curriculum as a response to the growing racial tensions amongst his students.[20] Through its connection to hip hop, Lamar studied rhymes, metaphors and double entendres, which made him fall in love with songwriting: \"You can put all your feelings down on a sheet of paper, and they'd make sense to you. I liked that.\"[3][20] Instead of completing assignments for other classes, Lamar would scribe lyrics in his notebooks.[20] His initial writing was entirely profane, but it helped him manage his psychological trauma and depression, which he struggled with during his adolescence.[20][21] Inge played a vital role in his intellectual growth, often critiquing his lexicon and suggesting prompts to strengthen his prose.[20]\n",
    "\n",
    "Lamar later attended Centennial High School.[22] He was enrolled in summer school during the tenth grade, which he dreaded because it forced him to be embroiled in a gang war.[22] Despite his efforts to avoid them, Lamar soon became heavily involved with Compton's hedonistic gang culture, which led to numerous health scares and encounters with the police.[3] He distanced himself from the lifestyle following an intervention staged by his father.[6] When he was 16, Lamar was baptized and converted to Christianity following the death of a friend.[23][24] He graduated from high school in 2005 as a straight-A student.[25][26] He flirted with the idea of studying psychology and astronomy in college, but suspended his academic pursuits to focus on his music career.[3][27]\n",

    "Lamar began his career while he attended Centennial High School\n",
    "\n",
    "During high school, Lamar adopted the stage name K.Dot and began freestyling and battle rapping at school.[28] His performances caught the attention of fellow student Dave Free, who traveled from Inglewood to watch him rap.[28] They quickly formed a friendship over their love of hip hop and the television sitcom Martin.[28] They recorded music together at Free's makeshift garage studio and at his older brother's Hyde Park apartment.[28] Lamar's earliest performances were held at a \"super hood\" comedy club and behind a tattoo parlor.[28] Free was his hype man during that time, while his older brother was his manager and disc jockey.[28] Lamar recorded five mixtapes throughout the 2000s; his first, Youngest Head Nigga in Charge (Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year), was released on April 15, 2003, through Konkrete Jungle Musik.[29] The mixtapes primarily consisted of freestyles over the production of popular hip hop songs.[29]\n",
    "\n",
    "In a series of retrospective reviews for Rolling Stone, Mosi Reeves complimented Lamar's \"unerring\" sense of rhythm and timing found in Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year, but criticized his \"clumsy\" lyricism and that his flow was \"overly beholden to ... Jay-Z and Lil Wayne\".[29] Free, who was working as a computer technician, introduced the mixtape to record producer Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith while attempting to repair his computer.[30] Tiffith was impressed with Lamar's burgeoning abilities and invited him to partake in an audition process for entry into his newly established independent record label, Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE).[30] During his audition, Lamar freestyled for Tiffith and record executive Terrence \"Punch\" Henderson for two hours, a strategy that impressed Henderson but bewildered Tiffith.[6][31] He was offered a recording contract by TDE in 2005, joining Jay Rock as the label's first signings.[6] Upon signing, he purchased a minority stake in the label for an undisclosed amount.[31]\n",
    "\n",
    "Lamar had a brief stint as a security guard when he started working on music with Jay Rock at TDE's in-house recording studio.[32][26] The bond he formed with him, Ab-Soul and Schoolboy Q led to the formation of the hip hop supergroup, Black Hippy.[33] Lamar released his second mixtape, Training Day, on December 30, 2005.[29] Reeves complemented its varied production and \"well-executed\" concept, which was based on the 2001 film of the same name.[29] In 2006, Lamar signed an artist development deal with Def Jam Recordings and was featured on two singles by the Game. He also heavily contributed to Jay Rock's first two mixtapes, Watts Finest Vol. 1 and Watts Finest Vol. 2: The Nickerson Files.[17][34] Lamar was ultimately let go from Def Jam after an encounter with its president and chief executive officer, Jay-Z; he later described it as \"one of those situations where I wasn't ready.\"[35][36] Lamar and Jay Rock released a collaborative mixtape, title No Sleep 'til NYC, on December 24, 2007.[29] Reeves thought the project was a \"fun cypher session, nothing more, nothing less.\"[29]\n",

    "\n",
    "Lamar's third mixtape C4, released on January 30, 2009, is a tribute project to Lil Wayne's Tha Carter III (2008) and was supported by his co-sign.[37] Reeves felt that the mixtape was a \"wrongheaded homage to a year-old, well-worn album.\"[29] From February to July, he toured with the Game on his LAX Tour as a hype man for Jay Rock.[38][39] Lamar disliked how his stage name diverted attention away from his true identity, and decided to retire it.[40] He opted to use his first and middle names professionally and regards the name change as part of his career growth.\"[41] For his eponymous debut extended play (2009),[42] Lamar eschewed the creative process of his mixtapes in favor of a project heavily focused on his songwriting over \"lovely yet doleful\" production.[29] Reeves described the EP as the \"first standout project\" of his career, praising its melancholic tone.[29] He felt that the project restored his reputation following the sting of criticism he received over C4.[29]\n",

    "After striking a music publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music,[43] Lamar released his fourth mixtape, Overly Dedicated, on September 14, 2010. It was his first project to be purchased through digital retailers.[44] Reeves described Overly Dedicated as a partial \"victory lap\" that marked a shift in his songwriting.[29] The mixtape peaked at number 72 on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.[45] Lamar served as Jay Rock's hype man for a second time during Tech N9ne's Independent Grind Tour, where Overly Dedicated was introduced to Dr. Dre.[46][47] After watching the music video for the song \"Ignorance Is Bliss\" on YouTube, he reached out to Lamar with hopes of working with him and Snoop Dogg on his unfinished album, Detox.[46][48] He also considered signing him to his record label, Aftermath Entertainment, and was encouraged to by artists such as J. Cole.[49][50]\n",

    "Lamar entered a brief relationship with Nitty Scott,[51][52] and was featured on XXL's 2011 Freshman Class list.[53] He released his debut studio album, Section.80, on July 2, 2011,[54] which was supported by its lead single \"HiiiPower\".[55] The album explored conscious and alternative hip hop styles and experimented with \"stripped-down\" jazz production.[56][57] Ogden Payne of Forbes considers it to be \"the genesis to [Lamar] successfully balancing social commentary with mass appeal.\"[58] Section.80 marked Lamar's first appearance on the Billboard 200 chart, where it peaked at number 113. It sold approximately 5,000 copies in its first week of tracking, with minimal coverage from mainstream media outlets.[59] To promote the album, Lamar performed at small venues and college campuses across the U.S.[60][61] He was dubbed the \"New King of the West Coast\" by Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and the Game during a performance in West Los Angeles.[62][63] Throughout the year, he appeared on the Game's The R.E.D. Album, Tech N9ne's All 6's and 7's, 9th Wonder's The Wonder Years, and Drake's Take Care.[64]\n",

Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune applauded him for giving gangsta tropes a \"twist, or sometimes upend[ing] them completely\" on a record that \"brims with comedy, complexity and the many voices in [Lamar's] head.\"[78] The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with 242,000 copies sold;[79] the highest first-week album sales of the year by a male rapper.[80] Good Kid, M.A.A.D City surpassed The Eminem Show (2002) to become the longest-charting hip hop studio album on the Billboard 200.[81] In October 2022, it became the first hip hop studio album to spend over ten consecutive years on the chart.[82]\n",

    "On March 5, 2020, Lamar and Dave Free launched the creative entity PGLang, which was described at the time as a multilingual, artist-friendly service company.[218][219] In October, he signed a worldwide administration agreement with Universal Music Publishing Group.[220] Lamar announced through an August 2021 blog post that he was in the process of producing his final album under TDE, confirming rumors that emerged last year that he would be leaving to focus on PGLang.[221][222] The following week, he appeared on Baby Keem's single \"Family Ties\", which won Best Rap Performance at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards.[223][224] Lamar made additional contributions to Baby Keem's album The Melodic Blue by providing background vocals and appearing on the song \"Range Brothers\".[225] In November, he held a \"theatrical exhibition of his musical eras\" during his second headlining performance at Day N Vegas,[226][227] and featured on Terrace Martin's album Drones.[228] He co-headlined the Super Bowl LVI halftime show alongside Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, 50 Cent, and Mary J. Blige on February 13, 2022, which won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Live).[229][230]\n",
    "\n",
    "After releasing the promotional single \"The Heart Part 5\",[231][232] Lamar's fifth album, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers, was released on May 13, 2022.[233] He and Alford used the album's cover art to announce the birth of their son, Enoch.[234][235] The double album drew on jazz, R&B, trap, and soul influences;[236][237] Alford served as its primary narrator.[238] It was widely acclaimed by critics, who applauded Lamar's vulnerable songwriting and scope.[239] Every track from the album charted on the Hot 100; its three singles–\"N95\", \"Silent Hill\", and \"Die Hard\"–debuted in the top-10.[240] Selling 295,000 units in its first week, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers became Lamar's fourth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard 200.[241] It later became the first hip hop album of the year to reach one billion streams on Spotify.[242]\n",
    "\n",
    "In support of Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers, Lamar embarked on the Big Steppers Tour, which ran from July 2022 to March 2024.[243] The tour grossed $110.9 million in worldwide revenue, becoming the highest-grossing rap tour ever at the time.[244] Lamar wrote, co-directed, and executive produced the short film adaptation of the song \"We Cry Together\", which was released worldwide in September 2022.[245] An accompanying concert film for the tour, Kendrick Lamar Live: The Big Steppers Tour, was released in November.[246][247] Lamar won Favorite Male Hip Hop Artist at the American Music Awards, and Favorite Hip Hop Album for Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers. He received six awards at the BET Hip Hop Awards, including Album of the Year.[248][249] During the 65th Annual Grammy Awards, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers was named Best Rap Album, while \"The Heart Part 5\" won Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song.[250]\n",
    "\n",
    "In May 2023, Lamar was featured on the standalone version of Beyoncé's single \"America Has a Problem\" and appeared on Baby Keem's single \"The Hillbillies\".[251][252] He won four awards at the BET Hip Hop Awards, and set four records in the process.[253] Lamar was featured in the documentary concert film Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé and executive produced Baby Keem's short film adaptation of The Melodic Blue.[254][255] He quietly shedded his ties with Aftermath Entertainment and signed a new direct licensing agreement with Interscope.[256]\n",

    "\n",
    "Lamar's conflict with Drake re-escalated in March 2024 with his surprise appearance on Future and Metro Boomin's track \"Like That\".[257] The song spent three consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Lamar's third number-one single and his first song to debut at the top spot.[258] From April to May, he released the Drake-aimed diss singles \"Euphoria\",[259] \"6:16 in LA\",[260] \"Meet the Grahams\",[261] and \"Not Like Us\"; all of which were either positively received or acclaimed by critics.[262] The latter installment marked the first rap song to lead the Hot 100 with a limited tracking week.[263] A celebratory one-off concert, titled The Pop Out: Ken & Friends, was held on Juneteenth.[264] On September 8, 2024, it was announced that Lamar would headline the Super Bowl LIX halftime show, marking the first time a rapper has led the performance as a solo act.[265] Three days later, he released an untitled song to his Instagram account.[266] On November 22, he shared a song titled \"GNX\", exclusively on YouTube, followed with a surprise release of the album of the same name on streaming the same day.[267][268] On December 17, he released a song called \"Money Without Me\" on YouTube, rumored to be from Section.80 sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of music, Lamar starred in the animated biographical film Piece by Piece (2024).[269] He signed on to produce a comedy feature with Free, Trey Parker and Matt Stone for Paramount Pictures, which is slated to be released on July 4, 2025.[270]\n",
    "Artistry\n",
    "Influences\n",
    "Lamar considers Tupac Shakur to be his biggest influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tupac Shakur is Lamar's biggest influence, having impacted both his professional and personal lives.[271] One of his earliest childhood memories is watching him and Dr. Dre film the second music video for their single \"California Love\" with his father at the Compton Swap Meet.[12] Lamar has described himself as an \"offspring\" of Shakur's artistry and sociopolitical views.[272] Although some publications regard him as the Shakur of his generation,[273][274] he strives to maintain his individuality.[275]\n",
    "\n",
    "Shakur's The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory (1996), The Notorious B.I.G.'s Life After Death (1997), and DMX's It's Dark and Hell is Hot (1998) influenced Lamar's artistic direction: \"I don't look at these albums like just music; it sounds like an actual film.\"[276] He also listened and took influence from Mos Def and Snoop Dogg during his childhood,[277] and said, \"I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Eazy-E.\"[278] 50 Cent's mixtape success inspired Lamar to become an independent artist,[6] while his view on being categorized as a conscious rapper, \"Yeah, I'm a conscious artist because I have a conscience,\" gave him a sense of perspective.[279]\n",
    "\n",
    "Prodigy of Mobb Deep was a key influence on Lamar's earlier mixtapes,[280] while his rapping technique was stemmed from Lil Wayne and his longevity.[281] Eminem and his album The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) introduced him to songwriting elements, such as ad-libs, and impacted his aggressive approach to records such as \"Backseat Freestyle\".[282][283][284] He took inspiration from N.W.A's tenacity of representing his hometown with \"courage, honesty and artistic brilliance.\"[285] Various R&B and soul artists, including Marvin Gaye,[286] the Isley Brothers,[286] Michael Jackson,[287] Teddy Pendergrass,[288] Sade, and Anita Baker, have influenced Lamar.[289] He performed with Prince, who impacted his vocal register,[290] at Paisley Park to celebrate the release of the latter's 2014 albums Plectrumelectrum and Art Official Age, which GQ described as \"five minutes of brilliant insanity.\"[291] To Pimp a Butterfly was influenced by the works of jazz trumpeter Miles Davis and funk collective Parliament-Funkadelic.[292]\n",
    "Musical style\n",
    "\n",
    "The nature of Lamar's musical style has been described as \"anti-flamboyant, interior and complex.\"[293] He is rooted in West Coast hip hop,[294] and has continually reinvented his sound by branching out into other genres.[295] Due to his contributions to its audience growth, through his appeal to mainstream listeners, music critics generally categorize Lamar as a progressive rap artist.[296] He suggests that his music is genreless, explaining in a 2012 interview, \"You really can't categorize my music, it's human music.\"[297] PopDust opined that during the 2010s, a decade that was arguably defined by hip hop, Lamar constantly pushed the boundaries of what the genre could be.[298]\n",
    "\n",
    "Lamar did not care for music production during the beginning of his career.[299] However, as he placed an emphasis on songwriting and \"making material that's universal\", he grew more exacting and adventurous with his compositions.[299] He is heavily involved with every aspect of his production process, including the mixing and mastering stages, and is known for working long hours in the recording studio.[300] \"You gotta be hands on and know the different sounds and frequencies,\" Lamar explained to Variety.[299] \"What makes people move, what melodies stick with you, taking the higher octaves and the lower octaves and learning how to intertwine that in a certain frequency, how to manipulate sound to your advantage.\"[299] Lamar chooses to work with a close-knit team of musicians, rather than constantly seek high-profile talent.[46] He has been working with his longtime producer, Sounwave, since his 2009 self-titled EP.[29]\n",
    "\n",
    "Kendrick Lamar marked a pivotal change in Lamar's artistry. Unlike his earlier mixtapes, which consisted of freestyles over CHR and urban radio singles, the EP incorporated melancholic and \"doleful\" original production that emphasized his lyrics.[29] Austere jazz production was blended with alternative rap styles on Section.80,[301] with instrumentals drawing from R&B, boom bap, psychedelia, and downtempo.[302] Good Kid, M.A.A.D City abandoned the tastes of contemporary hip hop by exploring a subtle, atmospheric side of West Coast hip hop and gangsta rap.[303][304] To Pimp a Butterfly is an amalgamation of genres synonymous with African-American music, most prominently jazz, funk, and soul.[305][306] It redefined jazz rap by highlighting improvisation and soloing rather than primarily using sampling.[307][308] Minimalist arrangements are incorporated in Damn and Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers.[309][310] Damn appealed to mainstream listeners through its pop and R&B-influenced production,[311] while the scattered and distorted instrumentals of Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers was designed to make listeners feel anxious and uncomfortable.[312]\n",
    "Voice\n",
    "\n",
    "Several media outlets consider Lamar to be the greatest and most important rapper of his generation.[313][314] Billboard, Forbes and Vibe named him the second-greatest rapper of all time, behind Jay-Z.[315][316] Described as a \"blazing\" technical rapper and \"relentless searcher\" by The New York Times,[293] Lamar's \"limber, dexterous\" flow switches from derivative to generative metrics,[317][318] while incorporating internal and multisyllabic rhyme schemes.[319] His rhymes are typically manipulated within common time, allowing him to subtly control his metrical phonology and suggest formal ambiguities similar to pop and rock repertoires.[319] Some of his rhyme manipulations feature \"flexible\" new school styles evoking the 1990s, while others use \"rigid\" old school elements recalling the 1980s.[319] Lamar frequently uses syncopation in his melodies to create contradictions between his lyrical content and rhythms.[320] With Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, he liberally plays with pronunciation, inflections, and delivery to mirror the album's emotional range.[321]\n",
    "\n",
    "Lamar possesses a versatile tenor vocal range[322][323] and a raspy, half-shout timbre, where \"his throat sounds dry and his mouth sounds wet.\"[324] André 3000 was the first rapper that introduced him to singing sensibilities in hip hop,[325] and he writes melody-driven songs as practice for his albums.[325] Lamar became comfortable with his vocals over time, to the point where he feels confident enough to create singing-based albums.[326] Pitchfork noticed how his harmonies on To Pimp a Butterfly never made him sound alone throughout his \"desolate\" performance; comparing his vocal layering to \"standing in the middle, unnoticed, of a large quarrelsome crowd.\"[327]\n",
    "\n",
    "Praised for his willingness to use his voice as an instrument,[328] Lamar adopts different cadences, tones, modulations, and timbres to suggest conflicting personalities, paint distinct emotions, and communicate stories using characters and personas.[329][330] His falsetto register, which he calls the \"ghetto falsetto\",[325] has been likened to Curtis Mayfield's.[331] MTV writes that by manipulating his voice, Lamar calls back to a lineage that runs through James Brown's foundational work in the 1960s, 1970s psychedelia, Prince's \"sweaty\" phantasmagoria in the 1980s, and 1990s gangsta rap.[332] He was ranked the tenth-best solo singer of the 21st century by The Times in 2023.[333]\n",

    "Several publications have compared Lamar's songwriting to Martin Scorsese (left) and Quentin Tarantino's (right) screenplays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Branded as a \"master of storytelling\" by The New Yorker,[330] Lamar has been referred to as one of the greatest lyricists in modern hip hop by several publications and his peers.[334][335] Pharrell Williams suggests that what makes his songwriting stand out is because he \"knows how to be very disciplined with a subject matter, he knows that stickiness is important, and he knows that it has to be great.\"[336] American Songwriter notes that for as much as Lamar is a musician, lyricist, and emcee, he is also \"a playwright, a novelist, a short story author. He's literary within the art form of music.\"[337] Lamar's reflective narrative songwriting pulls from a wide range of literary and cinematic techniques, such as hip hop skits and voice-overs, to allow his audience to follow internal and external storylines.[338] His fusion of various film styles and his sonic influence has elevated his works to be some of the most \"consistently poignant\" in hip hop, and promoted the advancement of the narrative device.[338]\n",
    "\n",
    "Lamar, who self-identifies as a musician and writer,[159] begins his songwriting process with an assortment of premeditated thoughts that he jotted down over the course of one year.[339] His personal experiences are a common source of inspiration, but he also pulls ideas from meeting new people, traveling, and experiencing different cultures.[339] A devout Christian, he additionally shares his spiritual triumphs and struggles on his songs.[340][341] He is an avid note-taker, and has developed keywords, phrases, and sounds to help him \"trigger the exact emotions\" he felt when writing the initial demo.[339] Considered to be a \"radio-friendly but overtly political rapper\" by Pitchfork,[342] and a populist by The Wall Street Journal,[343] Lamar's songwriting regularly infuses political criticism and social commentary concerning African-American culture.[344] Common themes explored include racial inequality, institutional discrimination, and black empowerment.[345] Lamar's critiques has been compared to the State of the Union Address by The Guardian,[346] while Billboard described it as \"Shakespearean\".[347] HuffPost opined that his work is a \"great\" piece of journalism because it \"speaks from the prerogative of black communities facing oppression and directly attacks the institutions responsible for their pain,\" an achievement most reporters cannot attain.[348]\n",
    "\n",
    "Lamar tries to carry a conceptual idea inside of his music, \"whether it's a big concept or it's so subtle you can't even tell until you get to 20 listens.\"[299] Fans and publications have theorized that his albums are related to different forms of mass media.[349] Section.80 is regarded as a short story collection inspired and themed around events that impacted the millennial generation, such as Ronald Reagan's presidency.[350][351] The nonlinear narrative structure of Good Kid, M.A.A.D City is billed as a coming-of-age short film that chronicles Lamar's harsh teenage experiences in his native Compton.[352][353] Its cinematic scope has been compared to the screenplays written by filmmakers Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino.[354][355] To Pimp a Butterfly unfolds as both a poem and blank letter that explores the responsibilities of being a role model and documents life as an African American during Barack Obama's presidency.[356][357] Damn is labeled as an introspective satire that explores the dualities of human nature and morality.[358][359] Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers takes on the form of a theatrical play, with confessional lyrics based on Lamar's experiences in therapy.[360][361]\n",

    "Lamar performing at the Festival Internacional de Benicàssim in 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "As one of the most influential musicians of the 2010s decade, Lamar has been deemed a paradigm shift in contemporary hip hop and popular culture.[362][363] His discography became a catalyst in the upsurge of social conscience across multiple generations; challenging the status quo by encouraging listeners to reexamine social institutions.[364] Throughout the Black Lives Matter movement and events following the 2016 U.S. presidential election, his work has been used as protest anthems.[365] According to American studies and media scholar William Hoynes, Lamar's progressive elements places him amongst other African American artists and activists who \"worked both inside and outside of the mainstream to advance a counterculture that opposes the racist stereotypes being propagated in white-owned media and culture.\"[366] He has been credited with reviving jazz rap and the music video as a form of social commentary.[367][368]\n",
    "\n",
    "Lamar's music has consistently garnered critical acclaim and commercial success—a rare combination in the music industry—as well as support from artists who have paved the way for his advancement, earning him the nickname \"King Kendrick\".[369][370] His Pulitzer Prize win was considered a sign of the American cultural elite formally recognizing hip hop as a \"legitimate artistic medium\".[371] Senior artists such as Nas,[372] Bruce Springsteen,[373] Eminem,[374] Dr. Dre,[375] Prince,[376] and Madonna have praised his musicianship.[377] David Bowie's final album, Blackstar (2016), was inspired by To Pimp a Butterfly, and its producer Tony Visconti praised Lamar as a \"rulebreaker\" in the music industry.[378][379] Pharrell Williams called him \"one of the greatest writers of our times\" and likened him to Bob Dylan.[380] Lamar has also been cited as a strong influence on the works of various modern artists,[381] including BTS,[382] Dua Lipa,[383] Tyler, the Creator,[384] Roddy Ricch,[385] and Rosalía.[386] Lorde regards him as \"the most popular and influential artist in modern music.\"[387]\n",

    "\n",
    "Despite becoming a prominent figure in popular culture, publications have noted Lamar's unconventional approach to celebrity culture.[388] He is notoriously reserved, reluctant to publicly discuss his personal life and generally avoids using social media.[389][390] He is also decisive when engaging with mainstream media outlets, although journalists have complimented his \"Zen-like\" calmness and down to earth personality.[391][392] According to Lamar, he has become \"so invested in who I am outside of being famous, sometimes that's all I know. I've always been a person that really didn't dive too headfirst into wanting and needing attention. I mean, we all love attention, but for me, I don't necessarily adore it.\"[393] His lyrics have been a topic of media scrutiny, leading to both praise and controversy.[16][394][395]\n",
    "\n",
    "Lamar's public perception has also been influenced by the various rap feuds he has been involved with.[396][397] Although journalists unanimously declared him the winner of his highly publicized conflict with Drake,[398] some felt that his victory was pyrrhic due to the severity of accusations introduced and the spread of online misinformation.[399][400] Following the release of Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, media outlets have described Lamar as the \"modern hip hop messiah\".[401] Some critics dislike his \"grating\" political infusions,[402] causing him to be viewed as having a savior complex.[403][404] However, Lamar has declared himself to be the \"greatest rapper alive\" due to his personal connection to hip hop.[405] \"I'm not doing it to have a good song, or one good rap, or a good hook, or a good bridge,\" he explained to Zane Lowe. \"I want to keep doing it every time, period. And to do it every time, you have to challenge yourself and you have to confirm to yourself—not anybody else, confirm to yourself that you're the best, period. [...] That's my drive and that's my hunger, I will always have.\"[406]\n",
    "Other ventures\n",
    "Entrepreneurship\n",
    "\n",
    "Lamar has been described as an \"authentic\" businessman who takes \"calculated steps to establish his brand from the ground-up\" and leaves nothing to chance.[407] He approaches traditional album rollouts with an unorthodox method, using creative Easter eggs and leaving cryptic messages.[408] Before releasing a studio album, Lamar shares a promotional single taken from \"The Heart\", a timestamp song series designed to \"observe the beating pulse behind his music.\"[409] The vulnerable themes explored on the non-album singles have strengthened his relationship with his \"inquisitive\" fanbase known as Kenfolk.[409][410] His real estate portfolio includes properties in California and New York.[411][412] In 2011, Lamar crafted an original song with record producer Nosaj Thing to promote Microsoft's Windows Phone in 2011.[413] He starred alongside DJ Calvin Harris and singer Ellie Goulding in a marketing campaign for Bacardi in 2014.[414]\n",

As a brand ambassador, he was involved with designing sneakers for Reebok and Nike.[417][418] He developed working relationships with Grace Wales Bonner and Martine Rose; through their respective eponymous brands, they have dressed him for several public events.[419] For her Autumn/Winter 2023 collection, Twilight Reverie, Lamar worked with Bonner to create the show's soundtrack with Sampha and Duval Timothy.[420][421] Through PGLang, he composed the score and co-designed the stage for Chanel's Spring/Summer 2024 haute couture collection.[422]\n",
    "Philanthropy and activism\n",
    "\n",
    "A supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, Lamar is a vocal advocate for racial equality.[423] In 2012, he commended Frank Ocean for coming out and endorsed Barack Obama's presidential re-election campaign, claiming his opponent Mitt Romney does not have a \"good heart\".[424][425] Lamar developed a strong friendship with Obama,[426] having worked on a promotional video for Obama's My Brother's Keeper initiative and performed at his Independence Day celebration at the White House.[427][428] He was critical of Donald Trump's first presidency and the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.[429][430]\n",

    "Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons. Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.\n",

      " Kendrick Lamar is one of the most influential hip-hop artists of his generation . He was awarded the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Music . He rose to prominence with his gangsta rap-influenced second album Good Kid, M.A.D City (2012) Rolling Stone named it the greatest concept album of all time . His third album, To Pimp a Butterfly (2015), infused hip hop with historical African-American music genres such as jazz, funk and soul . His fourth album, Damn (2017), yielded his second Hot 100 number-one single, \"Humble\"  When he was five years old, Lamar witnessed a murder for the first time while sitting outside of his apartment unit, as a teenage drug dealer was killed in a drive-by shooting . His parents nicknamed him \"Man-Man\" due to his precocious behavior . Lamar was introduced to poetry by his English teacher, Regis Inge, who integrated the literary form into his curriculum as a response to the growing racial tensions amongst his students . In high school, Lamar adopted the stage name K.Dot and began freestyling and battle rapping at school . He recorded five mixtapes throughout the 2000s; his first was released on April 15, 2003, through Konkrete Jungle Musik .  Lamar released his second mixtape, Training Day, on December 30, 2005 . He signed an artist development deal with Def Jam Recordings and was featured on two singles by the Game . Lamar's third mixtape C4, released on January 30, 2009, is a tribute project to Lil Wayne's Tha Carter III . For his eponymous debut extended play, Lamar eschewed the creative process of his mixtapes in favor of a project heavily focused on his songwriting over \"lovely yet doleful\" production . He released his debut studio album, Section.80, on July 2, 2011 .  Lamar opened for Drake on his Club Paradise Tour in February 2012 . He signed a joint venture recording contract with Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records . His second album, Good Kid, M.A.D City, was released on October 22, 2012 . The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with 242,000 copies sold . It became the first hip hop studio album to spend over ten consecutive years on the chart . Lamar won three awards each during the BET Awards and BET Hip Hop Awards, including Best New Artist at the former .  Lamar's third album, To Pimp a Butterfly, was released on March 15, 2015 . He earned his first number-one single in the U.S. through the remix of Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood\" The album incorporated various genres synonymous with African American music, such as jazz, funk, and soul . Lamar's high school sweetheart, Whitney Alford, contributed background vocals on select tracks . He opened the BET Awards with a controversial performance of \"Alright\" and won three awards at the BET Hip Hop Awards .  Lamar's fourth album, Damn, was released on April 14, 2017 . It was the seventh best-selling album of 2017, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) Lamar embarked on his first headlining arena tour, the Damn Tour, from July 2017 to July 2018 . He was featured on four commercially successful songs: Beyoncé's \"Freedom\",[154] Maroon 5's \"Don't Wanna Know\",[155] the Weeknd's \"Sidewalks\",[157] and Travis Scott's \"Goosebumps\"  Lamar's fifth album, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers, was released on May 13, 2022 . He and Whitney Alford welcomed their first child, Uzi, on July 26, 2019 . He co-headlined the Super Bowl LVI halftime show alongside Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, 50 Cent, and Mary J. Blige . He made his acting debut as a drug addict in the crime drama series Power (2018) Lamar and Dave Free launched the creative entity PGLang, which was described as a multilingual, artist-friendly service company .  Lamar's conflict with Drake re-escalated in March 2024 with his appearance on Future and Metro Boomin's track \"Like That\" The song spent three consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Lamar's third number-one single and his first song to debut at the top spot . On September 8, 2024, it was announced that Lamar would headline the Super Bowl LIX halftime show, marking the first time a rapper has led the performance as a solo act . On November 22, he shared a song titled \"GNX\", exclusively on YouTube, followed with a surprise release of the album of the same name on streaming the same day .  To Pimp a Butterfly is an amalgamation of genres synonymous with African-American music, most prominently jazz, funk, and soul . He is heavily involved with every aspect of his production process, including the mixing and mastering stages, and is known for working long hours in the recording studio . Lamar's \"limber, dexterous\" flow switches from derivative to generative metrics, while incorporating internal and multisyllabic rhyme schemes . His rhymes are typically manipulated within common time, allowing him to subtly control his metrical phonology .  Kendrick Lamar has been called one of the greatest lyricists in hip hop by several publications and his peers . Lamar's songwriting has been compared to Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino's screenplays . He is an avid note-taker, and has developed keywords, phrases, and sounds to help him \"trigger the exact emotions\" he felt when writing the initial demo . Considered to be a \"radio-friendly but overtly political rapper\" by Pitchfork and a populist by The Wall Street Journal . Common themes explored include racial inequality and institutional discrimination .  Lamar has been credited with reviving jazz rap and the music video as a form of social commentary . His Pulitzer Prize win was considered a sign of the American cultural elite recognizing hip hop as a \"legitimate artistic medium\" He has declared himself to be the \"greatest rapper alive\" due to his personal connection to hip hop . Lorde regards him as \"the most popular and influential artist in modern music\" Some critics dislike his \"grating\" political infusions, causing him to be viewed as having a savior complex .  Lamar has won 17 Grammy Awards, 37 BET Hip Hop Awards, 11 MTV Video Music Awards, 6 Billboard Music Awards and a Brit Award as a songwriter . Lamar has also partnered with several fashion designers and outlets as a brand ambassador . Lamar is a vocal advocate for racial equality . He is a supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement and the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision to overturn Roe v. Wade . Lamar was featured on Ebony's Power 100 list that honors leaders within the African American community in 2016 .  It was named the seventh greatest album of all time by Apple Music in 2024 . To Pimp a Butterfly was ranked by several publications as one of the greatest albums of the 2010s decade . \"Alright\" was deemed the greatest hip hop song of the streaming era by Spotify . It is the recipient of the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Music, the first time a musical work outside of the classical and jazz genres was honored . It was also named the greatest concept album ever by Rolling Magazines and Apple Music .\n",
