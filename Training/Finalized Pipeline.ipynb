Having won the 2024 presidential election as the nominee of the Republican Party, he is the president-elect and will be inaugurated as the 47th president on January 20, 2025.\n",

Becoming president of the family real estate business in 1971, he focused on luxury accommodation. After a series of business bankruptcies in the 1990s, he launched side ventures. From 2004 to 2015, he produced and hosted the reality television series The Apprentice.\n",

    "Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican nominee. His immigration policy included ordering a travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries, expanding the U.S.–Mexico border wall, and implementing a family separation policy. He rolled back more than 100 environmental policies and regulations, signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and nominated Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2018, he initiated a trade war with China. He withdrew the U.S. from international agreements on climate, trade, and the nuclear program of Iran. He met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un without progress on denuclearization. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, he downplayed its severity, contradicted guidance from international public health bodies, and signed the CARES Act economic stimulus. He was impeached in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and in 2021 for incitement of insurrection; the Senate acquitted him in both cases.\n",

    "Trump's politics and rhetoric led to the Trumpism movement. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged, racist, and misogynistic. He promoted conspiracy theories and made false and misleading statements during his campaigns and presidency, to a degree unprecedented in American politics. After his first term, scholars and historians ranked him as one of the worst presidents in American history. He lost the 2020 presidential election but did not concede, falsely claiming widespread electoral fraud and attempting to overturn the results, including through his involvement in the January 6 Capitol attack. In civil proceedings, Trump was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation in 2023, and financial fraud in 2024. In May 2024, he was found guilty of falsifying business records, making him the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. He faced more felony indictments related to his interference in the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents, which were dismissed after his victory in the 2024 election.\n",

In October 2024, the men sued Trump for defamation after he said in a televised September debate that they had committed the crime and killed the woman.[30]\n",

He has denied the allegations.[37] In October 2016, a 2005 \"hot mic\" recording surfaced in which Trump bragged about kissing and groping women without their consent, saying that, \"when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab 'em by the pussy.\"[38] Trump characterized the comments as \"locker-room talk\",[39][40] and the incident's widespread media exposure led to Trump's first public apology during his 2016 presidential campaign.[41]\n",

The order took effect immediately and without warning, causing chaos at airports.[273][274] Protests began at airports the next day,[273][274] and legal challenges resulted in nationwide preliminary injunctions.[275] A March 6 revised order, which excluded Iraq and gave other exemptions, again was blocked by federal judges in three states.[276][277] In a decision in June 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the ban could be enforced on visitors who lack a \"credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States\".[278]\n",

Taylor Jr., the chargé d'affaires for Ukraine, testified before congressional committees that soon after arriving in Ukraine in June 2019, he found that Zelenskyy was being subjected to pressure directed by Trump and led by Giuliani.

    "Research suggests Trump's rhetoric is associated with an increased incidence of hate crimes.[748][749] During his 2016 campaign, he urged or praised physical attacks against protesters or reporters.[750][751] Numerous defendants investigated or prosecuted for violent acts and hate crimes, including participants in the storming of the U.S. Capitol, cited his rhetoric in arguing that they were not culpable or should receive leniency.[752][753] A nationwide review by ABC News in May 2020 identified at least 54 criminal cases from August 2015 to April 2020 in which he was invoked in direct connection with violence or threats of violence mostly by white men and primarily against minorities.[754]\n",

    "Fact-checkers from The Washington Post,[755] the Toronto Star,[756] and CNN[757] compiled data on \"false or misleading claims\" (orange background), and \"false claims\" (violet foreground), respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a candidate and as president, Trump frequently made false statements in public remarks[758][149] to an extent unprecedented in American politics.[758][759][760] His falsehoods are a distinctive part of his political identity[759] and have been described as firehosing.[761] His false and misleading statements were documented by fact-checkers, including at The Washington Post, which tallied 30,573 false or misleading statements made by him during his first presidency,[755] increasing in frequency over time.[762]\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of Trump's falsehoods were inconsequential, such as his repeated claim of the \"biggest inaugural crowd ever\".[763][764] Others had more far-reaching effects, such as his promotion of antimalarial drugs as an unproven treatment for COVID-19,[765][766] causing a U.S. shortage of these drugs and panic-buying in Africa and South Asia.[767][768] Other misinformation, such as misattributing a rise in crime in England and Wales to the \"spread of radical Islamic terror\", served his domestic political purposes.[769] His attacks on mail-in ballots and other election practices weakened public faith in the integrity of the 2020 presidential election,[770][771] while his disinformation about the pandemic delayed and weakened the national response to it.[772][773][774] Trump habitually does not apologize for his falsehoods.[775]\n",
    "\n",
    "Until 2018, the media rarely referred to Trump's falsehoods as lies, including when he repeated demonstrably false statements.[776][777][778]\n",
    "Conspiracy theories\n",
    "Main article: List of conspiracy theories promoted by Donald Trump\n",
    "\n",
    "Before and throughout his presidency, Trump promoted numerous conspiracy theories, including Obama birtherism, the Clinton body count conspiracy theory, the conspiracy theory movement QAnon, the Global warming hoax theory, Trump Tower wiretapping allegations, that Osama bin Laden was alive and Obama and Biden had members of Navy SEAL Team 6 killed, and alleged Ukrainian interference in U.S. elections.[779][780][781][782][783] In at least two instances, Trump clarified to press that he believed the conspiracy theory in question.[781]\n",
    "\n",
    "During and since the 2020 presidential election, Trump promoted various conspiracy theories for his defeat.[784][785][786]\n",
    "Social media\n",
    "Main article: Social media use by Donald Trump\n",
    "\n",
    "Trump's social media presence attracted worldwide attention after he joined Twitter in 2009. He tweeted frequently during his 2016 campaign and as president until Twitter banned him after the January 6 attack.[787] He often used Twitter to communicate directly with the public and sideline the press.[788] In June 2017, the White House press secretary said that his tweets were official presidential statements.[789]\n",
    "\n",
    "After years of criticism for allowing Trump to post misinformation and falsehoods, Twitter began to tag some of his tweets with fact-checks in May 2020.[790] In response, he tweeted that social media platforms \"totally silence\" conservatives and that he would \"strongly regulate, or close them down\".[791] In the days after the storming of the Capitol, he was banned from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other platforms.[792] The loss of his social media presence diminished his ability to shape events[793][794] and prompted a dramatic decrease in the volume of misinformation shared on Twitter.[795] In February 2022, he launched social media platform Truth Social where he only attracted a fraction of his Twitter following.[796] Elon Musk, after acquiring Twitter, reinstated his Twitter account in November 2022.[797][798] Meta Platforms' two-year ban lapsed in January 2023, allowing him to return to Facebook and Instagram,[799] although in 2024, he continued to call the company an \"enemy of the people\".[800]\n",
    "Relationship with the press\n",
    "Further information: First presidency of Donald Trump § Relationship with the news media\n",
    "Trump, seated at the Resolute Desk in the White House, speaking to a crowd of reporters with boom microphones in front of him and public officials behind him\n",
    "Trump talking to the press, March 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "Trump sought media attention throughout his career, sustaining a \"love-hate\" relationship with the press.[801] In the 2016 campaign, he benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[146] The New York Times writer Amy Chozick wrote in 2018 that his media dominance enthralled the public and created \"must-see TV\".[802]\n",
    "\n",
    "As a candidate and as president, Trump frequently accused the press of bias, calling it the \"fake news media\" and \"the enemy of the people\".[803] In 2018, journalist Lesley Stahl said that he had privately told her that he intentionally discredited the media \"so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you\".[804]\n",
    "\n",
    "As president, Trump mused about revoking the press credentials of journalists he viewed as critical.[805] His administration moved to revoke the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts.[806] The Trump White House held about a hundred formal press briefings in 2017, declining by half during 2018 and to two in 2019.[806]\n",
    "\n",
    "Trump also deployed the legal system to intimidate the press.[807] The Trump campaign sued The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN for defamation in opinion pieces about Russian election interference. All the suits were dismissed.[808] By 2024, he repeatedly voiced support for outlawing political dissent and criticism he considers misleading or challenges his claims to power,[809] and that media companies should be investigated and prosecuted for treason for displaying \"bad stories\" about him and possibly lose their broadcast licenses if they refuse to name confidential sources.[810]\n",
    "Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "To pass on his wealth, Fred Trump gave each of his children $6,000 every year, the maximum allowed without incurring a gift tax. To avoid taxes, after making them landlords of two of his housing developments, he paid them each $13,928 rent every year. Three years old when this began, Donald Trump was a millionaire in 2024 dollars by age eight.[110]\n",
    "Trump acknowledged a negative net worth in 1990 of minus $900 million in his book The Art of the Comeback.[113] Timothy L. O'Brien explains in his book TrumpNation that Forbes dropped Trump from its list of wealthiest Americans from 1990–1995. In 1997, Forbes acknowledged Trump's negative net worth of minus $900 million.[114]\n",
